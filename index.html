You knew how to check the page source? Thats wonderful! Now you only need to learn how to solve this riddle, and then you'll be on your way.

In realms of code, my notes unfold,
A digital symphony, ageless and bold.
Crafted by keystrokes, my melodies sway,
In the world of blocks, I hold my sway.
Whose name am I, in the realm of sound,
Where pixels dance and echoes abound?

Take your answer, remove any potential letters, and multiply it by 45. X and Z are identical.
